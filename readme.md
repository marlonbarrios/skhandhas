## Concept
"Skhandhas" is an immersive generative art experience inspired by the profound Buddhist concept of the **Five Aggregates** or **Skandha**. In Sanskrit, _Skandha_ (स्कन्ध) translates to "multitude, quantity, aggregate," and is a term deeply embedded in the discourse around consciousness, form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and discernment. This project seeks to visualize the transient and interconnected nature of existence through dynamic particle interactions and formations, guided by the principles of Buddhist philosophy.

## Background
The concept of Skandha plays a significant role in Vedic literature and Buddhist teachings, symbolizing the elements that come together to form a sentient being's perception of existence. It challenges the notion of a permanent self, presenting life as an aggregation of sensory experiences and mental activities. "Skhandhas" explores these ideas through visual and auditory mediums, creating a space for contemplation and insight.

## Technical Overview
Employing the creative coding library p5.js, "Skhandhas" brings to life a particle system where each entity behaves according to algorithms that mimic the interplay of the Skandhas. The project integrates:

- **Generative Art**: Visual formations that evolve and dissolve, reflecting the impermanence of the aggregates.
- **Creative Coding**: Crafted with p5.js to simulate complex particle dynamics and interactions.
- **Music Integration**: An original soundtrack that complements the visual journey, deepening the immersive experience.

### Features
- **Dynamic Particle Systems**: Visualizing up to 1000 particles, each representing an aspect of the Skandhas, moving in variable formations.
- **Formation Modes**: Simulating the concept of "no-self" with particles occasionally aligning in patterns or following each other in a coordinated "dance".
- **Collision Detection**: A mechanism ensuring particles maintain distinct paths, symbolizing the unique journey of each aggregate.
- **Interactive Soundtrack**: A soundscape that users can control, reflecting the influence of mindfulness on perception.

## Live Application
Dive into the "Skhandhas" experience [here](https://marlonbarrios.github.io/skhandhas/). Navigate the visual representation of the Skandhas, accompanied by a thematic soundtrack, to explore the Buddhist teachings on the nature of existence.

### How to Interact
- **Soundtrack**: Toggle the background soundtrack by pressing 'P', adding an auditory layer to the visual meditation.
- **Observation**: Watch the evolving patterns and formations as particles drift, align, and disperse.

## Concept, Programming, and Music
Conceptualized and developed by Marlon Barrios Solano, "Skhandhas" is a testament to the intersection of digital art, programming, and spiritual philosophy, inviting users to reflect on the nature of existence and the illusion of self.
